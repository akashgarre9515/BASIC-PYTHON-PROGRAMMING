# BASIC-PYTHON-PROGRAMMING
Syntax basics: Python uses indentation to define code blocks instead of braces {}.  Variables: Store data values; dynamically typed (no need to declare type).  Data types: Integers, floats, strings, booleans, lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries.  Operators: Arithmetic (+, -, *, /), comparison (==, !=), logical (and, or, not).
